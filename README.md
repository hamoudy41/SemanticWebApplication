<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites


* None


### Installation

This is a step by step guide on how to run this application.

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/chileluk/kd_final_project.git
```
2. Set up a triplestore. You may choose any triplestore but we recommend GraphDB since that is what we have been using during this project and hence we can offer you support in case of technical difficulties.

3. Create a repository in GraphDB and call it `ent_ontology`.

4. Make this repository as your default repository in GraphDB. After following these steps you do not need to configure repository URL since it will automatically be set as `http://localhost:7200/repositories/ent_ontology` and it will be accessesed by the application. In case if you run into a problem or if your triplestore have a different IP address than your local machine you will need to configure the `localEndpoint` into the exact urlof your repository. This should be done in the following step.

    
    * Open `index.js`
    * àt line 1 where you find
    ```JS
    const localEndpoint = "http://localhost:7200/repositories/ent_ontology"
    ```
    replace `http://localhost:7200/repositories/ent_ontology` with your repository URL.
    
4. Upload the file `ent_ontology.ttl` into your repository you just created.
  
5. Navigate to the root folder of the project.
  
6. Run the following command in the terminal
```sh
start index.html
```
